Lately, I’ve been diving into HTML, one tag at a time, and it’s been a pretty eye-opening experience. I always knew websites had some sort of structure behind them, but learning how that structure actually works has made the web feel a lot less like magic and more like something I can build myself.
<br>
<br>
Through tags like <strong>header</strong>, <strong>section</strong>, and <strong>footer</strong>, I’ve started to see how each page is carefully organized. It’s like laying the foundation and framework for a house. Everything needs a place, and every piece has a purpose. Writing clean, semantic HTML has helped me understand not just what goes on a page, but why it’s there.
<br>
<br>
Now, I’ve just started exploring CSS, and I can already tell it’s going to be a game changer. While HTML sets things up, CSS is where the creativity comes in. It’s what makes a site feel modern, clean, and personalized. I’ve only scratched the surface. Changing colors, tweaking spacing, trying out fonts, but I’m excited to keep going.
<br>
<br>
This is just the beginning of my journey into web development. HTML gave me the foundation, and CSS is the next big milestone. One line of code at a time, I’m getting closer to bringing my own ideas to life online..
