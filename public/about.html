<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>  My Developer Journey</h2>
<p>Hi, I'm Ada Wayran, a Web Developer and Graphic Designer.</p>
<p>I'm passionate about creating visually striking and meaningful designs that communicate effectively.</p>
<p> 
I began my developer journey knowing one thing for sure: 
I wanted to be part of the fast-moving world of technology and the endless 
opportunities that come with it. I'm passionate about learning new skills and using my 
creativity to communicate through visually striking and meaningful designs.

<p>
While working full-time in nature research, I started learning on the side—watching 
YouTube channels by experienced developers and graphic designers, and exploring free resources 
like FreeCodeCamp to pick up the basics of coding. As I gained more confidence, I took things further with
 online courses on Udemy. One course that truly jumpstarted my journey was the Full-Stack 
 Development Bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu. It opened the door to a deeper understanding 
 of web development and fueled my excitement even more.

I can’t wait to see how this skillset will evolve and where it will take me next!
