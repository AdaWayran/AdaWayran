      <p>Learning GitHub was a big step in my journey as a creator. At first, version control, setting up repositories, and managing commits and branches felt confusing, but with time, I started to understand how powerful and helpful these tools really are. A major milestone was launching my first website for <a href="https://adawayran.github.io/NotYourAvarageDJs/"><i>Not Your Average DJs</i></a>, a duo I’ve been excited to support. I also learned how to apply CSS to give the site a personal and polished look, making the project feel truly mine. <br><br> Using GitHub Pages made it easy to host and update the site, and I quickly saw the value of clear commit messages and staying organized. This experience taught me that GitHub isn’t just for developers. It’s for anyone building something worth sharing. <br><br>And for me, this is just the beginning.</p>

      <p>Lately, I’ve been diving into HTML, one tag at a time, and it’s been a pretty eye-opening experience. I always knew websites had some sort of structure behind them, but learning how that structure actually works has made the web feel a lot less like magic and more like something I can build myself.
      <br>
      <br>
      Through tags like <strong>header</strong>, <strong>section</strong>, and <strong>footer</strong>, I’ve started to see how each page is carefully organized. It’s like laying the foundation and framework for a house. Everything needs a place, and every piece has a purpose. Writing clean, semantic HTML has helped me understand not just what goes on a page, but why it’s there.
      <br>
      <br>
      Now, I’ve just started exploring CSS, and I can already tell it’s going to be a game changer. While HTML sets things up, CSS is where the creativity comes in. It’s what makes a site feel modern, clean, and personalized. I’ve only scratched the surface. Changing colors, tweaking spacing, trying out fonts, but I’m excited to keep going.
      <br>
      <br>
      This is just the beginning of my journey into web development. HTML gave me the foundation, and CSS is the next big milestone. One line of code at a time, I’m getting closer to bringing my own ideas to life online..</p>
